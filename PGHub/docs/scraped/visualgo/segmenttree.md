A Segment Tree (ST) is a binary tree that is build on top of an (usually Integer) array so that we can solve the Range Min/Max/Sum (other variants are possible) Query (abbreviated as RMinQ/RMaxQ/RSumQ) as well as any Range (that includes Point) Update Query of this array in O(log **N**) time instead of the naive O( **N**) time. Given an array A of **N** (usually Integer) elements, we can build the corresponding RMinQ/RMaxQ/RSumQ Segment Tree in O( **N**) time.

View the visualization of Segment Tree (tree on top of an array) here!

The tree on the top side shows the Segment Tree structure. The vertices are indexed in the same manner as with [Binary Heap](https://visualgo.net/en/heap) data structure where the root is at index 1 and the left/right child of a vertex **p** is **2\*p**/ **2\*p+1**, respectively. The value inside each vertex shows the MinIndex/MaxIndex/Sum value of the corresponding range/segment **\[L,R\]** of the underlying array **A**. We put " **p:\[L,R\]**" identifier in red color below each vertex except when **L=R** and that segment corresponds to a single array index (only that index is shown).

Vertices that are lazily updated will have this purple ring highlight. This lazy update technique will be explained in subsequent slides.

* * *

Pro-tip 2: We designed this visualization and this e-Lecture mode to look good on 1366x768 resolution **or larger** (typical modern laptop resolution in 2021). We recommend using Google Chrome to access VisuAlgo. Go to full screen mode ( **F11**) to enjoy this setup. However, you can use zoom-in ( **Ctrl +**) or zoom-out ( **Ctrl -**) to calibrate this.

The bottommost row shows the content of the underlying array **A** (yellow colored) from which the Segment Tree structure is built.

Each leaf vertex in the Segment Tree corresponds to an individual index in the corresponding array A. For Min ST and Max ST, the leaf vertex in the Segment Tree contains the index itself (the minimum/maximum element of a subarray with just one element is that element itself). For Sum ST, the leaf vertex in the Segment Tree contains the only value of that single-element subarray.

* * *

Pro-tip 3: Other than using the typical media UI at the bottom of the page, you can also control the animation playback using keyboard shortcuts (in Exploration Mode): **Spacebar** to play/pause/replay the animation, **←**/ **→** to step the animation backwards/forwards, respectively, and **-**/ **+** to decrease/increase the animation speed, respectively.

There are three basic operations that are available in Segment Tree data structure visualization (for all 3 modes: RMinQ/RMaxQ/RSumQ):

1. You can create RMinQ/RMaxQ/RSumQ Segment Tree from either a user-defined array of integers (maximum of 16 two-digits integer), or let the system provide a small random integer array or a small random but sorted integer array.
2. You can do RMinQ/RMaxQ/RSumQ by specifying a left (L) and a right (R) indices.
3. You can do Range Update by specifying a left (L) index, a right (R) index, and a new VALUE for this range \[L,R\]. We employ lazy update strategy for fast performance. You can still do Point Update (updating a single index only) by setting L = R.

For the details of these three operations, read CP4 or attend live CS3233 class.

Unfortunately, this data structure is not yet available in C++ STL, Python, Java API, or OCaml Standard Library as of 2024. Therefore, we have to write our own implementation.

Please look at the following C++/Python/Java/OCaml implementations of this Segment Tree data structure in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) fashion: [segmenttree\_ds.cpp](https://github.com/stevenhalim/cpbook-code/blob/master/ch2/ourown/segmenttree_ds.cpp) \| [py](https://github.com/stevenhalim/cpbook-code/blob/master/ch2/ourown/segmenttree_ds.py) \| [java](https://github.com/stevenhalim/cpbook-code/blob/master/ch2/ourown/segmenttree_ds.java) \| [ml](https://github.com/stevenhalim/cpbook-code/blob/master/ch2/ourown/segmenttree_ds.ml)

Again, you are free to customize this custom library implementation to suit your needs.

#### About

✕

Initially conceived in 2011 by Associate Professor Steven Halim, VisuAlgo aimed to facilitate a deeper understanding of data structures and algorithms for his students by providing a self-paced, interactive learning platform.

Featuring numerous advanced algorithms discussed in Dr. Steven Halim's book, 'Competitive Programming' — co-authored with Dr. Felix Halim and Dr. Suhendry Effendy — VisuAlgo remains the exclusive platform for visualizing and animating several of these complex algorithms even after a decade.

While primarily designed for National University of Singapore (NUS) students enrolled in various data structure and algorithm courses (e.g., CS1010/equivalent, CS2040/equivalent (including IT5003), CS3230, CS3233, and CS4234), VisuAlgo also serves as a valuable resource for inquisitive minds worldwide, promoting online learning.

Initially, VisuAlgo was not designed for small touch screens like smartphones, as intricate algorithm visualizations required substantial pixel space and click-and-drag interactions. For an optimal user experience, a minimum screen resolution of 1366x768 is recommended. However, since April 2022, a mobile (lite) version of VisuAlgo has been made available, making it possible to use a subset of VisuAlgo features on smartphone screens.

VisuAlgo remains a work in progress, with the ongoing development of more complex visualizations. At present, the platform features 24 visualization modules.

Equipped with a built-in question generator and answer verifier, VisuAlgo's "online quiz system" enables students to test their knowledge of basic data structures and algorithms. Questions are randomly generated based on specific rules, and students' answers are automatically graded upon submission to our grading server. As more CS instructors adopt this online quiz system worldwide, it could effectively eliminate manual basic data structure and algorithm questions from standard Computer Science exams in many universities. By assigning a small (but non-zero) weight to passing the online quiz, CS instructors can significantly enhance their students' mastery of these basic concepts, as they have access to an almost unlimited number of practice questions that can be instantly verified before taking the online quiz. Each VisuAlgo visualization module now includes its own online quiz component.

VisuAlgo has been translated into three primary languages: English, Chinese, and Indonesian. Additionally, we have authored public notes about VisuAlgo in various languages, including Indonesian, Korean, Vietnamese, and Thai:

#### Privacy Policy

✕

**Version 1.2 (Updated Fri, 18 Aug 2023).**

Since Fri, 18 Aug 2023, we no longer use Google Analytics. Thus, all cookies that we use now are solely for the operations of this website. The annoying cookie-consent popup is now turned off even for first-time visitors.

Since Fri, 07 Jun 2023, thanks to a generous donation by Optiver, anyone in the world can self-create a VisuAlgo account to store a few customization settings (e.g., layout mode, default language, playback speed, etc).

Additionally, for NUS students, by using a VisuAlgo account (a tuple of NUS official email address, student name as in the class roster, and a password that is encrypted on the server side — no other personal data is stored), you are giving a consent for your course lecturer to keep track of your e-lecture slides reading and online quiz training progresses that is needed to run the course smoothly. Your VisuAlgo account will also be needed for taking NUS official VisuAlgo Online Quizzes and thus passing your account credentials to another person to do the Online Quiz on your behalf constitutes an academic offense. Your user account will be purged after the conclusion of the course unless you choose to keep your account (OPT-IN). Access to the full VisuAlgo database (with encrypted passwords) is limited to Prof Halim himself.

For other CS lecturers worldwide who have written to Steven, a VisuAlgo account (your (non-NUS) email address, you can use any display name, and encrypted password) is needed to distinguish your online credential versus the rest of the world. Your account will have CS lecturer specific features, namely the ability to see the hidden slides that contain (interesting) answers to the questions presented in the preceding slides before the hidden slides. You can also access Hard setting of the VisuAlgo Online Quizzes. You can freely use the material to enhance your data structures and algorithm classes. Note that there can be other CS lecturer specific features in the future.

For anyone with VisuAlgo account, you can remove your own account by yourself should you wish to no longer be associated with VisuAlgo tool.
